## Abstract
Any person looking to improve their intuitive eating or better their personal diet. Everyone’s body processes food differently for a myriad of reasons: ancestry, medical history, acquired allergies, lifestyle, etc. Whether you’re an athlete looking to improve your performance by way of nutrition, someone looking to pinpoint the source of a digestive problem, or a person wanting to develop a more clean energy source and find a diet that works for your body, Food Diary can help you!

For the most accurate results, track everything you consume for a minimum of 2 weeks along with notable symptoms to evaluate the best diet for you.

Look up over 600k items of food (natural food or by brand) to view their nutrient info, view your past food logs, create a new food log, receive trend alerts.

## Learning Goals
- Create an application with React, React Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, and robust testing
- Utilizing an api, deliver a unique product to help an audience in some way

## Setup
```
git clone [file path name]
cd food-diary
npm install 
npm start
```

## In Action
### If an entry is submitted with the same symptom associated with a food item from a different day, a new trend notification will alert
